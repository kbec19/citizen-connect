description: The goal of the member amplification program is to expand engagement by Americans with 
  Citizen Connect members by featuring their most compelling and timely content. This will be accomplished
  by regularly amplifying select members and their content via our social media assets in coordination with
  the social media teams from the Citizen Connect member community. This project contains background and
  proposals to accomplish this goal.
