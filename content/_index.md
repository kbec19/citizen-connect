description: The objective of this project is to provide the Bridge Alliance Education Fund with a   solid  foundation to begin the next phase of their work in amplifying itsâ€™ member voices across         initiatives. One of the newest initiatives, Citizen Connect, has been operating for one year and is     ready to scale their presence. We have provided an analysis of the existing communication and member amplification programs, strategies to use this information to create an effective plan, and resources to assist them with the growth of their initiative.
