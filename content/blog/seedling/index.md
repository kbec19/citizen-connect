## Acquisition Metrics

How do people get to your website?

### Google Analytics Specific

#### Direct

People who type the url directly into the search bar or click a link in an email. This doesn’t include campaign tag - campaign tags are custom parameters you can add to campaign URLs to track specific data.

#### Other

Everything that can’t be placed or is placed incorrectly - this can be fixed manually.

#### Paid Search

#### Social 

Directed from Social Media channels

#### Referral

Comes from sites outside the search engine (other people linked to you)

#### Organic Search

#### Email

Directed from links embedded in emails/newsletters

## Behavior Metrics

what do they do once they get there?

#### Bounce Rate 

The percentage of visitors to a particular website who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page (single page exits) 

#### Conversions 

User-defined goal (for Citizen Connect right now, a conversion = a user staying on for 30-60-90 seconds)

#### Drop Off 

When a user exits the website, different from a bounce in that they’ve clicked through to at least one other page

#### Exits

When people leave your website after clicking through to at least one additional page after the landing page

#### Landing Page

Where visitors enter your website

#### Referral

When a user clicks through to your website from another website

### Source vs Medium

#### Source

Parameter for evaluating how people find your website, tells you where message was seen

#### Medium

Parameter for evaluating how people find your website, tells you how message was communicated


# Social Media Metric Guide

Information provided by Hootsuite

## Core Metrics By Category

### Awareness Metrics

These numbers show how many people see your content and how much attention your content gets on social media.

#### Reach

Reach is simply the number of unique users who were shown your content during its lifetime. It’s a good ideato monitor your average reach, as well as the reach of each individual post, story, or video.

A valuable subset of this metric is to look at what percentage of your reach is made up of followers vs. non-followers. If a lot of non-followers are seeing your content, that means it’s being shared or doing well in the algorithms, or both.

#### Average Reach Per Post

Average Reach per Post is the average number of unique users to whom a Facebook/Instagram post or Instagram story was displayed during its lifetime.

#### Impressions

Impressions indicate the number of times the content was displayed to a user during its lifetime. It can be higher than reach because the same person might look at your content more than once.

An especially high level of impressions compared to reach means people are looking at a post multiple times. Do some digging to see if you can understand why it’s so sticky.

#### Audience growth rate

Audience growth rate measures how many new followers your brand gets on social media within a certain amount of time.

It’s not a simple count of your new followers. Instead, it measures your new followers as a percentage of your total audience. So when you’re just starting out, getting 10 or 100 new followers in a month can give you a high growth rate.

But once you have a larger existing audience, you need more new followers to maintain that momentum.
To calculate your audience growth rate, track your net new followers (on each platform) over a reporting period. Then divide that number by your total audience (on each platform) and multiply by 100 to get your audience growth rate percentage.

### Engagement Metrics

Social media engagement metrics show how much people interact with your content, as opposed to just seeing it.

#### Engagement Rate

Engagement Rate measures the number of engagements (reactions, comments and shares) the content gets as a percentage of the audience.

How you define “audience” may vary. You might want to calculate engagement relative to your number of followers. But remember that not all your followers will see each post. Plus, you might get engagement from people who don’t (yet) follow you.

So, there are multiple ways to calculate engagement. So many, in fact, that we dedicated a whole blog post to the many ways to measure engagement rate.

Engagement rate benchmarks:

Facebook: 0.06%
Instagram: 0.68%

Note: These benchmarks are based on engagements as a percentage of followers.

#### Engagement Rate Per Impression

Engagement Rate (per Impression) is the number of times that users engaged with the content as a percentage of impressions during its lifetime.

#### Daily Engagement Per Post

How much the public is responding to each one of the posts on the same day that each post was published. Includes engagement data from Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn.

#### Total Engagement Per Post

Total number of written interactions that the general public has in response to original content published. Includes engagement data from Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn.

#### Reactions

Reactions is the number of users who liked or reacted to the content during its lifetime.

#### Comments
Comments is the number of comments on your post or messages received on the content during the post or story’s lifetime.

#### Shares

Shares is the number of times that users shared or retweeted the content during its lifetime.

#### Amplification rate

Amplification Rate is the ratio of shares per post to the number of overall followers.

Coined by Avinash Kaushik, author and digital marketing evangelist at Google, amplification is “the rate at which your followers take your content and share it through their networks.”

Basically, the higher your amplification rate, the more your followers are expanding your reach for you.

To calculate amplification rate, divide a post’s total number of shares by your total number of followers. Multiply by 100 to get your amplification rate as a percentage.

#### Virality Rate

Virality rate is similar to amplification rate in that it measures how much your content is shared. However, virality rate calculates shares as a percentage of impressions rather than as a percentage of followers.

Remember that every time someone shares your content, it achieves a fresh set of impressions via their audience. So virality rate measures how your content is spreading exponentially.

To calculate virality rate, divide a post’s number of shares by its impressions. Multiply by 100 to get your virality rate as a percentage.

### Video Metrics

#### Video Views

If you’re creating videos (you’re creating videos, right?), you want to know how many people are watching them. Each social network determines what counts as a “view” a little differently, but usually, even a few seconds of watch time counts as a “view.”

Video Views is the number of times that a video was viewed during the post’s lifetime.

So, video views is a good at-a-glance indicator of how many people have seen at least the start of your video, but it’s not as important as…

#### Video Completion Rate

How often do people actually watch your videos all the way through to the end? This is a good indicator that you’re creating quality content that connects with your audience.

Video completion rate is a key signal to many social media algorithms, so this is a good one to focus on improving!

### ROI Metrics

What’s the return on your social investment? These metrics will help you figure that out.

#### Click-Through Rate (CTR)

Click-through rate, or CTR, is how often people click a link in your post to access additional content. That could be anything from a blog post to your online store.

CTR gives you a sense of how many people saw your social content and wanted to know more. It’s a good indicator of how well your social content promotes your offering.

To calculate CTR, divide the total number of clicks for a post by the total number of impressions. Multiply by 100 to get your CTR as a percentage.

Click-through rate benchmarks:
Q1 2021: 1.1%
Q2 2021: 1.1%
Q3 2021: 1.2%
Q4 2021: 1.2%
Q1 2022: 1.1%

Note: These benchmarks refer to the CTR on paid social ads, rather than organic content.

#### Conversion Rate

Conversion rate measures how often your social content starts the process to a conversion event like a subscription, download, or sale. This is one of the most important social media marketing metrics because it shows the value of your social content as a means of feeding your funnel.

UTM parameters are the key to making your social conversions trackable. 

Once you’ve added your UTMs, calculate conversion rate by dividing the number of conversions by the number of visitors.

Conversion rate benchmarks:

Grocery: 6.8%
Pharmaceuticals: 6.8%
Health & beauty: 3.9%
Travel & hospitality: 3.9%
Home goods & furnishings: 2.8%
Consumer electronics: 1.4%
Luxury: 1.1%
Automotive: 0.7%
B2B: 0.6%
Telecoms: 0.5%
Media: 0.4%
Financial services: 0.2%
Energy: 0.1%

Note: These industry-specific conversion rate benchmarks apply to ecommerce (i.e., sales), though of course, a purchase is not the only kind of valuable conversion!

#### Cost-Per-Click (CPC)

Cost-per-click, or CPC, is the amount you pay per individual click on a social ad.
Knowing the lifetime value of a customer for your business, or even the average order value, will help you put this number in important context.

A higher lifetime value of a customer combined with a high conversion rate means you can afford to spend more per click to get visitors to your website in the first place.

You don’t need to calculate CPC: You can find it in the analytics for the social network where you’re running your ad.

Cost per click benchmarks:

Q1 2021: $0.52
Q2 2021: $0.60
Q3 2021: $0.71
Q4 2021: $0.70
Q1 2022: $0.62

Note: These benchmarks come from search advertising rather than social ads, but the numbers give a good impression of how CPC is trending.

#### Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM)

Cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, is exactly what it sounds like. It’s the cost you pay for every thousand impressions of your social media ad.

CPM is all about views, not actions.

Again, there’s nothing to calculate here—just import the data from your social network’s analytics.

CPM benchmarks:
Q1 2021: $5.87
Q2 2021: $7.21
Q3 2021: $7.62
Q4 2021: $8.86
Q1 2022: $6.75
