# Content Amplification Plan

## Objective and Approach

Expand engagement by Americans with Citizen Connect members by featuring their most compelling and timely content. This will be accomplished by regularly amplifying select members and their content via our social media assets in coordination with the social media teams from the Citizen Connect member community.

### Process - Featured Organizations and Content

On the third Monday of each month a slate of 8-9 organizations and 8-9 on-demand content items for the following month will be proposed at the CC Ops Call. Feedback will be solicited from the whole CC team and a final list will be approved in that session. 

#### Required Deliverables

Revisit list of “best CC social partners” and Bridge Alliance social footprint doc to guide the selection of our first wave of orgs and on-demand. We may also need to ask featured orgs to tighten up their profile text and provide brief on-demand content “teasers” as an onramp for their longer form content.

+ Potential changes based on the news cycle, we need to be nimble

+ There is an intersection of three things - what’s hot? Which organizations have the relevant content? Who plays nicely?

+ How do we get new info on CC quickly and out to the BA if needing.

+ Tie into the newsletter(s) - need to be clear to every member of our community that if you want to be promoted

+ Coffee party

### Process - Social Media Promotion of Featured Organizations and Content

Before the third Thursday of each month social media promotional materials will be produced to support all the next month’s featured orgs and on-demand content. 

#### Required Deliverables

Process already in place, but let’s review our approach to ensure it fully reflects social best practices. Worth running it by Nevins and Associates and RebelMouse.

Note: Because the featured event program is weekly, we won’t be able to schedule everything a month in advance.  However, the same core principles and processes will apply and just occur every Monday and Thursday.

### Process - Plan Outreach to Featured Organizations/Content Providers

At the third Thursday CC team meeting the featured member outreach plan will be discussed and finalized. This will include outreach to our day-to-day member contact and senior management. Required 
#### Required Deliverables

Revisit current “your featured” emails – language looks pretty good, but we need to ensure they make taking desired actions as easy as possible.  We also need to develop language for senior management outreach – and determine who is the optimal CC team member to contact each leader.

We don’t make it easy enough to allow people to do the right thing. - Social CRM? Measure who are sharing and reward that

### Process - Execute Outreach to Featured Organizations/Content Providers

During the fourth week of each month notifications will go out to “featured” day-to-day contacts and their senior managers. During the first three months of this program, we should also be ready to provide follow-up nudges via email, text or phone. 

#### Required Deliverables

We need to make sure featured orgs are following us on all relevant social platforms and that they are aware of the other featured CC members and content they are expected to amplify. Again, we need to make participation in this program extremely easy.

### Process - Posting Content to Social Media and Tracking Impact

Once we start dropping content on social media we will need a dashboard to track the degree to which members are leaning into the amplification program. We also need to track the impact of amplification to share back with our members and thereby make a compelling case for their participation. 

#### Required Deliverables

Augment our current CC metrics to reflect this program. Looking for Kristina to take lead on this with support from Amber, Cambria and the Coffee Party team. We’ll also need to develop metric summaries to share with CC member orgs that demonstrate the win-win impact of amplification. In addition, we should determine the data we want back from CC members to enrich our impact metrics, including conversion data

### Process - Live Stream Programming

Having our CC Livestream show up and running isn’t required to launch this program, but it will play an important role in supporting it. The content of the show itself will mirror the orgs, on-demand content and events we feature each month – and will include interviews with leaders from our community. When the time is right, planning for the show will be integrated into the third Thursday team meeting. 

#### Required Deliverables

Finalized livestream “run of show” and programming schedule for the rest of 2022.


### Additional Thoughts

#### How can paid advertising supplement this process?
