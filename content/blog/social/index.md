# Currently on the Radar:

+ Week/Weekend Wrap-Up
+ Live Stream Show
+ Engaging Content



## Live Stream Show

Already in discussion for this - will be an important addition to creating unique opportunities to amplify the community.

#### [Link to working draft of live stream show script in development](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dgC-fhoHnAjOGePxP2Fv7D7gAzzm8Vip/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109140489664263918222&rtpof=true&sd=true)


## Live Week/Weekend Wrap-Up

Potential opportunity to discuss the weekly events, content, and/or members in a quick, 10-minute or less 'summary' live streaming on one platform and replaying as a reel/story/video on the others. Add the ability to click links in the comments and engage in a different way to get some new users interested in the site.


## Animated Content

Having a consistent branding can be helpful, but it can also leave social media users in particular feeling like all of the images they see on the page look the same.

Posting more engaging content, and utilizing Instagram Reels and Facebook Stories more, can be a good way to continue the testing for social media relevance and engagement. An example created for the new Midterm Election page on the Citizen Connect site is an example of one where initial test results after cross-promotion on Citizen Connect and the Coffee Party pages drew 4 times the average clicks as a static post.
