intro:  This project is a product of a collaboration between the Bridge Alliance Education Fund and the University of Massachusetts Amherst DACSS program (Data Analytics and Computation for Social Sciences). As and internship provider for DACSS student Kristina Becvar, the Bridge Alliance Education Fund also provided the opportunity for a research group in the capstone course, Advanced Data-Driven Analytics, to explore a project to benefit their Citizen Connect initiative and to give DACSS students Lissie Bates-Haus, PhD. and Kristina Becvar the opportunity to utilize their research and technical skills in providing a complete project presentation. In addition to the project resources listed at right, the full documentation, codes, scripts, and research is housed in the GitHub repository linked below as well on the navigation page of the Research section of this site.
