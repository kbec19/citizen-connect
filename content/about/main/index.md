intro:   Using the analysis of social media metrics and the science of social media behavior, we will     present a strategy that will allow Citizen Connect opportunities to amplify members’ messages           more effectively through social media and internet search. The analysis will help Citizen Connect in    working toward their overarching goals of serving as a hub of “findability” for civic renewal           organizations and a gateway to civic renewal organizations for citizens looking for some resources for  “sensemaking” and outlets for involvement in their local, regional, and national civic spheres.
