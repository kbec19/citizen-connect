intro:  Our research has culminated in a set of opportunities that match the goals identified through the first iterations of the site. Each opportunity serves the goals of developing Citizen Connect as a hub of “findability” for civic renewal organizations and a gateway to civic renewal organizations for citizens looking for some resources for “sensemaking” and outlets for involvement in their local, regional, and national civic spheres. It is our goal to find partners interesting in expanding our capacity to allow Citizen Connect to amplify members’ messages more effectively and develop our audience exponentially.
