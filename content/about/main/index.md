  Citizen Connect is a non-partisan platform dedicated to one thing only – helping Americans find ways to heal our political divides and strengthen our democracy. Citizen Connect believes the best way to do that is to make it easy to find the civic organizations and events that matter most to each person.
  
  Citizen Connect was founded by people from all walks of life, political parties, races, identities, and religions. What they have in common is a conviction that America is stronger if we, the people, work together. It isn’t about agreeing on everything; it’s about finding what we can agree on and making it happen.
