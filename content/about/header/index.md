### Goals and Objectives

Using the research established by Citizen Connect, independent research, and the study of social media network behavior, we are presenting opportunities that will allow Citizen Connect to amplify members’ messages more effectively. In presenting this information in a living and evolving static site, we hope that this initial presentation can evolve into a hub for benchmarks and key performance indicators for Citizen Connect to utilize going forward. 

Our research has culminated in a set of opportunities that match the goals identified through the process of creating a project agreement, conducting stakeholder interviews, and data-driven insights. We believe this analysis will help Citizen Connect in working toward the overarching goals identified of serving as both a hub of “findability” for civic renewal organizations and a gateway to civic renewal organizations for citizens looking for some resources for “sensemaking” and outlets for involvement in their local, regional, and national civic spheres. 

Citizen Connect remains on the path they set when they launched in August 2021 to "solidify Citizen Connect’s role as the universally recognized “front door” for citizens seeking to explore the civic renewal movement. For our members, we will become an invaluable and indispensable partner in their efforts to engage mainstream citizens as supporters, donors and volunteers. We also see significantly advancing knowledge about what it takes to get American citizens excited about and participating in our collective work. These best practices will be shared with the entire community and should play a major role in bringing citizen engagement to critical mass".
