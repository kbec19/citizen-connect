# Citizen Connect is already measuring KPI metrics, and this is a quick summary of what the industry standards are for comparison.


## Bounce Rate

### There are many analytics that offer 'standards' of what constitutes a good bounce rate, which is in essence when someone gets to the site and clicks away without engaging further. A general standard we found is that 50% or lower is an acceptable bounce rate, and over 70% is concerning.

## Time On Site

### As with all metrics, it is not a universal standard among marketing consultants, but a satisfactory time users spend on site is 2-3 minutes or more. Any time under 30 seconds is concerning.

## Another important metric is the number of pages viewed per visit. Anything over 1.4 seems to be agreed to be reasonable. Lower than that should be a cause for concern.



## Industry Standards are Changing

### Google Analytics GA4 is the new analytics method offered by Google for website performance analysis, and will be the only option available after July 1, 2023. There will be a lot of benefits to the way that Citizen Connect can begin using GA4 when it is possible to convert the site to this method of analysis. Under GA4:


### IP Addresses will no longer be stored, making it GDPR compliant and offering more privacy.

### GA4 will utilize machine learning to optimize focus on mobile device-based usage.

### Rather than using the traditional "bounce rate" visit meets the criteria of engaged if it includes one or more of the following:

#### + More than one page view.

#### + Results in one or more conversion events.

#### + Lasts more than 10 seconds.
