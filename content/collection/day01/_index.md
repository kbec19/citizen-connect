#### Analysis

Clearly, Facebook is the largest driver of traffic to Citizen Connect among social media channels. The presence on LinkedIn is small, so the engagement there is reasonable to expect. The Instagram engagement is reasonable as well. In addition to having a small presence in followers on Instagram, the social media plan has not included a linktree or similar traffic management tool. Links in Instagram posts are not clickable, but a linktree directing traffic to the event/content being promoted has helped drive this engagement higher since being implemented in fall 2022.
