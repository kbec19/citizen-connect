## A/B Message Testing for Social Media

Below are the results of our initial ad tests for Citizen Connect
Video Tests:
How the Audiences Were Designed: 
We tested 3 audiences for initial reception. With an additional budget, we hope to do more extensive testing, including specialized outreach and testing in rural communities and faith communities, as well as using tools such as lookalike audiences to build additional audiences. The 3 audiences tested were:
Conservatives: For the conservative audience, we created an audience based on the 50 most conservative Congressional Districts in America and set the behavior for those who are likely to engage with US Political Content for both conservative and moderate content. 
Veterans / Active Duty: For the veteran audience, we created the audience based on people who are interested in certain groups such as the Wounded Warrior Project, United States Air Force, Army, Army National Guard, Veterans, United States Military Academy, Air force or Military Spouse. 
Socially Conscious: For the socially conscious audience, we created the audience based on people who are interested in certain topics, such as humanitarianism, social democracy, community issues, and social issues. 
Lookalike Audience: This lookalike was designed based on all of the individuals who signed up for America Talks. While those individuals were not specifically targeted, the lookalike audience found Facebook users who look similar to those users.  
While not used in these initial tests, Citizen Connect already has audiences based on the 2016 Pivot Districts (Districts that voted Obama > Obama > Trump indicating shifting demographics or those who have been left behind), The Most Rural Congressional Districts in America, and the Most Politically Intolerant Counties in America.

Ad Test 1 Insights:

Cost Per Thruplay and Avg. Watch Time is similar across all three tested audiences. The average video view time for the America Talks video was 12 seconds. Citizen Connect is already planning on creating new, shorter test videos ensuring that there is a hook in the first 3 seconds. 
Cost per Thru Play to reach nontraditional audiences is roughly comparable to America Talks. For that, we had a $0.03 cost per thu play for the video, and for the socially conscious, veterans, and conservative audiences it was between $0.02 and $0.03
Conservatives were more likely to click on the ad than the other 2 tested audiences. 
Even though we reached a higher number of individuals in the socially conscious audience than the conservative audience (at the same budget), conservatives watched the video at higher rates.
Veterans had the lowest CPM, indicating a strong opportunity to reach them at a lower budget.
All video ads had a cost per engagement of $0.01.

Ad Test 2 Insights:


Cost Per Thruplay was the lowest among Conservatives (optimized for engagement) and showed an improvement over the previous ads test.
The average video view time significantly improved over the previous ads test and had the same average watch time as the America Talks video.  
LookAlike audiences or Conservatives had the same likelihood of clicking on the ad
The ad numbers was lower for this test (as we were also looking at video views and engagement, plus a total of 12 image ads so the budget for each ad was lower).
Image Tests 
Image Test 1 Copy: 
All Ads were tested using the conservative audience listed under video tests. We tested 3 different images and 2 variations of the copy. The 3 images included the Capitol Building, an image with a family, and the Washington Memorial. For the Washington Memorial, we tested it against the language from our website versus more patriotic language appealing to conservative audiences.

Image Test 1 Insights:

Patriotic Language performed better than the test language for the Memorial Imagery. Using Patriotic Language also had the lowest CPM than other tested images.
Family Imagery performed best of all in terms of CTR, CPLPV, Clicks, and CPC
CPC was roughly similar for all tested images with a cost of $0.08 and $0.09. 
The Citizen Connect Team is actively meeting with individuals who identify as conservative to determine what language they find particularly impactful in order to meaningfully increase open rates. 
For ads that we ran during America Talks to a similar audience, we had a $0.31 CPC and $16.35 CPM. While the barrier to entry was higher for those events (registering for a particular event), the relatively low cost here indicates a strong receptiveness towards the type of content Citizen Connect is creating. 

Image Test 2 Copy: 
All Ads were tested using the LookAlike audience and Conservative audience and utilized 6 different images to test. As the ads used the same ad budget, Facebook auto-optimized for which ads were performing best (hence significantly lower numbers on some ads. This will be changed for future tests). Tested images below. LA conveys how the ad performed with the LookAlike audience versus CD is the Conservative audience.

Image Test 2 Results:


Image Test 2 Insights:

The three best-performing images in terms of engagements were the sunset flag, blue sky flag, and family dog. The family dog was performing so highly that partway through the test we turned off the ad so it didn’t eat the rest of the budget. 
Despite a high number of engagements and impressions, the blue sky flag did not yield a high number of link clicks. It had the highest cost per click of any ad.
These ads had a higher CPC than America Talks ($0.31 CPC on Average) and cost more than the previous rounds of tests on average.
While we expected family imagery to perform better, as it had in past ad tests, that was not the case with this set of ads, with family imagery consistently underperforming the flag imagery and family dog imagery. This may be due to the fact that in the initial few hours of the test this imagery was not performing as strongly so Facebook dropped all of the family imagery significantly. 

Image Test 3 Copy: 
Images were tested against the Lookalike audience, the conservative audience, and the veteran’s audience, all of which have been utilized in previous ad tests.  LA conveys how the ad performed with the LookAlike audience, CD is the Conservative audience, and VA is a Veteran’s Audience. In addition, we utilized a “targeted event audience” for a faith-based event to promote one event to compare the ad against the lookalike audience to see event conversion. Ads were optimized for reach as opposed to link clicks. 

National Park 



National Park Familly



Spiritual Framework Event


Image Test 3 Results:

Image Test 3 Insights:
When optimized for link clocks strong performance for CTR with the majority of ads in the 6% CTR range. 
Even though Facebook optimized to show the national park ad to a higher number of people for all ad sets, the National Park family ad had a higher CTR than the national park ad for conservative and lookalike audience (and a similar CTR for veteran audiences). 
Targeting for an event had a higher CPC than general citizen connect ad and was overall more expensive. However, if Citizen Connect wants to advertise an event, customizing the audience to those who express similar likes on Facebook cost only ⅓ of the amount of pushing it to the wider look alike audience. The CTR for the targeted ad also outperformed some of the regular ad tests. 

May 25th Ad Tests:
Important note: These were the first tests we optimized per lead for the Facebook pixel. This indicates that someone not only went to the website, but then clicked either on “Events” or “Organizations” indicating an interest in taking a next step. 
Dates: Test ran from May 12th to May 25th
Audience(s): 
General Audience, United States, 18+
Veterans and Military Audiences 
Financials: A total spend of $1808.28, $70 per day per audience. 
Top Insights:
With roughly the same spend, the general audience generated almost twice as many website leads and ½ the cost
Cost per lead for General Audience was $5.69 and for the Veteran Audience it was $11.90 
Engagement with the post was fairly consistent for both audiences, with almost equal number of comments [despite there being significantly less people in the Veterans Audience], veterans being slightly more likely to share the post.
Veterans had a higher unique outbound CTR than the general audience 
In the General Audience, the ads which converted leads were the Take Back Power: We the people [131 leads], National Park 1 [11 Leads] Take Back Power: Flag [9 Leads], Division: Cats and Dogs [7], and Democracy Needs a Huge [1]. 
The two lead expensive cost per leads were the National Park 1 image [$4.13] Take Back Power: We the People [$5.06].
It is important to note that the second National Park image received no conversions. 
Democracy Needs a Hug was the least expensive cost per landing page view and the highest outbound CTR at 3%. However, since it wasn’t converting people to leads at a high rate Facebook deprioritized this compared to other ads  
In the Veterans audience, the ads which converted leads were the Take Back Power: We the People [65 Leads], Take Back Power: Flag [8 Leads], Division: Cats and Dogs [2 Leads], and National park 1 [1 Lead]. 
The least expensive cost per lead was the Division: Cats and Dogs [$7.54} Followed by Take Back Power: We the People [$11.40]. 
The Two highest outbound CTRs were for the Take Back Power: Rosie ad as wekk as the Human Division Ad, though neither generated any conversions. Despite having the least expensive cost per lead, the Division: Cats and Dogs actuall had the lowest outbound CTR [that still had any conversions]. 
Creative 




May 25th Ad Tests:
These ad tests were to test 4 forms of creative geared at pushing people directly to 2 events and 2 pieces of on-demand content. We had to optimize based on link clicks, as we have not been able to figure out how to embed the Facebook pixel for conversion tracking into the CC widget. Gray is currently working on it. 
Dates: Test ran from May 12th to May 25th
Audience(s): 
General Audience, United States, 18+
Veterans and Military Audiences 
Financials: A total spend of $723.66 with the ad set dividing the spend between $62 per day across the 4 ads. . 
Top Insights:
2 of the ads so vastly out-performed the other 2 that I had to turn off those ads in order to generate any conversions for the other ads. Both of those ads that performed exceptionally wells ere for events, not on-demand pieces of content. 
It would be helpful to hear from the Unify Challenge and National Civic League if they actually had in increase in traffic to their website between the period of June 3rd and June 14th, That will help us know if these efforts to push events are actually fruitful. 

Social Budget Recommendations:
In addition to the recommendations below, Citizen Connect will continue to explore opportunities with partners to grow social and email reach and welcomes opportunities to use lookalike audiences to grow the impact outreach into nontraditional bridging communities, as well as opportunities to work with influencers to develop trust in these communities. While the initial tests were based on 2 tests, a larger investment of time and money would allow Citizen Connect time to dive deep in terms of developing new assets, copy, and audiences. In addition, with Google Ad Grants, Citizen Connect will be able to use several thousand dollars per month in free ad credits.
